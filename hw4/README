HW4: OpenGL 3&4

MAKE/RUN:
	Type make to compile, and ./hw4 to run

HOW TO USE:
	Welp, it's example 6 turned into example 7 (hopefully). So just switch to the programmable pipeline and see the magic.

Citations:
	I collaborated with Hunter Haskins, used ex06 as a starting point, and heavily looked at the phong lighting from past homeworks.

Time to complete:
	About 6 hours
